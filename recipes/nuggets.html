        <h2> What are chicken nuggets and why are they so good?</h2>
        <p>Chicken Nuggets are bite-sized pieces of chicken that are breaded 
            and deep-fried (or baked). They are typically made from ground 
            chicken that's seasoned, shaped into small pieces, coated in batter 
            or breadcrumbs, and then cooked until crispy on the outside and 
            tender on the inside.</p>
        <p>They are so good because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="dot">they are crispy outside, juicy inside.</li>
            <li class="dot">of fried goodness, deep-frying brings out rich flavors and a crispy texture that's hard to resist. </li>
            <li class="dot">of dipping sauces, they pair perfectly with a variety of sauces.</li>
        </ul>
