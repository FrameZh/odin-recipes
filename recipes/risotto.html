        <h2> What is Mushroom Risotto and why is it so good?</h2>
        <p>Mushroom risotto is a creamy, Italian rice dish made by slowly 
            cooking typically Arborio rice with broth, white wine, butter, Parmesan 
            cheese, and saut√©ed mushrooms. The result is a rich, velvety dish 
            with deep, umami-packed mushroom flavor</p>
        <p>It is so good because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="dot">of the creamy yet al dente texture.</li>
            <li class="dot">of the umami overload.</li>
            <li class="dot">the combination of butter and Parmesan cheese makes it indulgent and comforting.</li>
            <li class="dot">of the slow-cooked love, making risotto takes patience, but the stirring and gradual broth absorption create a luxurious texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh 
            so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well.</p>

            <li class="dot">2 medium shallots, diced</li>
            <li class="dot">1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li class="dot">1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li class="dot">4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li class="dot">3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li class="dot">1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li class="dot">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Follow the instructions step-by-step:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="dot">Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li class="dot">Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li class="dot">Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li class="dot">Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>
            <li class="dot">Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li class="dot">Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li class="dot">Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
