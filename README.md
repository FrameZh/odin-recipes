# odin-recipes
This is my first odin's project. I'll create a Website from scratch using
the skills I have acquired during these lessons. The website will consist of a 
main index page that will contain links to three recipes. I have chosen the following ones: Chicken Nuggets, Mushroom Risotto and Strawberry Cheesecake. Hope you will enjoy the project as much as I enjoy these dishes.
